Hey there, I'm Mystical an independent free spirit who loves graphic designing and making signature tags. I have been designing for nearly six years now. I love it!! I decided to created Utopia as a way for ladies to come together in one place who love collecting siggies, having a little chit chat, a laugh or two, having fun, and making friendships along the way. I love where life have has taken me so far and looking forward to the journey life takes me on next..
